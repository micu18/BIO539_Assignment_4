# BIO539_Assignment_4
## Python assignment
### This exercise allows a user to analyze a string of letters (input as a file and intended to portray the genome of an organism), and to obtain several pieces of information about its substrings (defined as kmers). 
### Kmers are substrings of length k that can contain one or more letters out of the four possible ones: A, C, G, and T. The information about kmers given by the output includes:
#### 1. Counting kmers of size k, where k is specified as an argument;
#### 2. Printing a data frame with all possible k and the associated number of observed and expected kmers;
#### 3. Computed linguistic complexity of the sequence; and
#### 4. A graph with the proportion of each kmer.
### The script contains several functions that are used for creating the output. The user has the option of testing the proper functionality of these functions by running the test_ file attached.
